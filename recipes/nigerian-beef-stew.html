        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nigerian Beef Stew is a rich and hearty dish that is a staple in Nigerian cuisine. Itâ€™s known for its deep red color, which comes from a blend of tomatoes and red bell peppers. 
            The stew is typically made with beef, which is seasoned and cooked until tender. Aromatic spices like ginger, garlic, and chili peppers add layers of flavor, creating a slightly spicy and incredibly savory stew.</p>
