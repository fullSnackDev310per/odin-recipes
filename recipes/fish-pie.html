                <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
                <p>Nigerian fish pie is an alternative to the quintessential party snack known as meat pie. However, I must say I prefer the rich umami flavor that a fish pie offers. Unlike the traditional British fish pie, which is typically baked, the Nigerian fish pie is deep-fried dough filled with fish, such as mackerel or sardines, along with various spices and vegetables.</p>
